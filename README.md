For fun analysis into r/tea recommendation, practice transforming data by scraping the table off: https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/wiki/vendors/page_01

Data analysis, primarily with the work of creating tea style tags by turning the comment values from a string into a better formatted string and then splitting it into an iterable list to compare terms within defined lists.

Update - 23 May 2020: Still a work in progress. Need to better define key terms to tag more entries.
